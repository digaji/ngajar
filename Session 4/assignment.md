Write a program for a guessing game. Tell the user to pick a number from 1 - 100 (you can put a lower upper range). Take the user's input (int) and the program will tell if the user's guess is correct. If the user's input is not correct, tell them if the guess was too high or too low.
You may incorporate a while loop, if you already understand, to let the program run until a guess is correct.

Hint: To get a random integer, you can utilize:
```python
import random
randomint = random.randint(1, 100) # In this case the range is from 1 to 100
```

Push the file to a GitHub repo (it can be where you store your code too) and send me the link to the specific file / repo through e-mail or Discord.
