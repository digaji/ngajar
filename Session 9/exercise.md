# No. 1
Create a function that prints a statement after a given amount of time (initial lag). The function accepts two arguments, one being the statement that's printed (str), and the other being the time delay (int).

Sample input and output:
```python
delay("This is message", 5)

# Output -> This is message (PRINTED AFTER 5 SECONDS)
```

# No. 2
Create a function to create a diamond pattern. Tell the user to specify the height of the diamond and then print the diamond pattern with that specified height.
```
Total height = (2 * width - 1)
```
Extra points if you can do with just one for loop
This one needs a bit of math / pattern logic

# No. 3 (Optional)
Create a function that can check if a prime also has an emirp (the prime number but reversed).

An example would be the number 13 as its reverse, 31, is also a prime number.
Another example would be the number 347 as its reverse, 743, is also a prime number.

The function returns the boolean True and prints both the number and the emirp if the number passed in is a prime and also has an emirp. Otherwise, return False and print "False!".

Sample input and output:
```python
emirpCheck(13)

# Output -> 13 31

emirpCheck(347)

# Output -> 347 743

emirpCheck(5)

# Output -> False!
```
